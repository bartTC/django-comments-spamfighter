===========================

This app contributes a CommentModerator that doees two things:

* Block or moderate new comments if they contain a given keyword.
  This keyword might be a regular expression or a simple string.
  You can add and edit these keywords using Django's admin interface.

* Block or moderate comments with Akismet.

Docs will follow soon. So long here is a sample installation. However, see
Django's comments moderator docs for a general installation::

    from comments_spamfighter.moderation import SpamFighterModerator

    class EntryModerator(SpamFighterModerator):

    	# Regular options by django's contributed CommentModerator
        auto_moderate_field = 'created'
        email_notification = True

        # ====================
        # Spam fighter options
        # ====================

        # Check with Akismet for spam
        akismet_check = False

        # If Akismet marks this message as spam, delete it instantly (True) or
        # add it the comment the moderation queue (False). Default is False.
        akismet_check_moderate = False

        # Do a keyword check
        keyword_check = True

        # If a keyword is found, delete it instantly (True) or add the comment to
        # the moderation queue (False). Default is True.
        keyword_check_moderate = False

    moderator.register(Entry, EntryModerator)
