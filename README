django-comments-spamfighter
===========================

This Django application contributes a moderation class to Djangoâ€™s comment app that provides:

* Check incoming comments against the Akismet spam database and either block
  them directly or add them to the moderation queue.

* Check incoming comments against pre-defined keywords and either block them
  directly or add these them to the moderation queue. These keywords can be
  simple strings or powerful regular expressions.

The documentation is online::

        # Spam fighter options

        # Check with Akismet for spam

        # add it the comment the moderation queue (True). Default is True.
        akismet_check_moderate = True
