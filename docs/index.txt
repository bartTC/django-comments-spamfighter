Comments Spamfighter Documentation
==================================

This Django application contributes a moderation class to Django's comment app
that provides:

* Check incoming comments against the Akismet_ spam database and either block
  them directly or add them to the moderation queue.

* Check incoming comments against pre-defined keywords and either block them
  directly or add these them to the moderation queue. These keywords can be
  simple strings or powerful regular expressions.

.. note:: Comments spamfighter needs Django 1.1 and up. It does not work with
   Django 1.0!
